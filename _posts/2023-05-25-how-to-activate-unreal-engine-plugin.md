It is suposed that you have the plugin already installed for your project. If you don't know how to install a plugin, you can refer to this link from official documentation: <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/working-with-plugins-in-unreal-engine/#installingpluginsfromtheunrealenginemarketplace">Installing Plugins from the Unreal Engine Marketplace</a>. It also applies to Unreal Engine 4.27 version.

For this example I'll be using <a href="https://tvillalbac.github.io/blog/redirectors-fixer-plugin/">TVC Redirectors Fixer plugin</a> which is a plugin that I developed for fixing redirectors right after move or rename operations in Content Browser.

After having the plugin installed properly in your project, for activating the plugin go to Plugins window by clicking on Edit menu and next on Plugins.

Once the Plugins window is open, search for "tvc" or "redirectors" in the search bar. The plugin will be shown in the main section unactivated.

You need to click on the checkbox in the plugin section to activate it. Once it's done, a message will display in the window advicing that you must restart the editor for the changes to take effect. You can click on "Restart Now" button to restart the engine.

After the engine has been restarted, you can use the plugin.
