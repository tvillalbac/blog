## Web programmer

### *Freelance / Vila-real (Castellón), Spain / July 2011- April 2019*
After having experience in sales and passionate about coding for the web, I run my own webpages business, specialized on big companies. I enjoyed a lot during many years but because my passion for 3d videogames I decided to switch my career to videogames industry and learn all the necessary on my free time until I considered that I had a good portfolio for applying for a big company.  
- Coding in the main languages used in webpages as Html, Css, javascript and 
sql,

## Technical Artist

### *elite3d / Valencia, Spain / May 2019- December 2019 (On site/Remote)*
As a AAA outsourcing studio, in elite3d I had the chance to work on a big variety of 
projects and production tools. I learned there to be a jack of all trades and learned from 
the tech art mates of the client companies as I was the only technical artist with 
advanced coding skills at the studio.
- For The Division 2 Episode 2 ( 15 environment artists) I had the chance of 
working in creating a lot of cloths, Substance Painter smart materials for 
helping the team to paint the masks for the layered material system of 
environmental models and help on setting the actors in Snowdrop, even the 
physics and destruction of the assets we produced at the studio. I also did 
documentation about the tools created and some other docs for helping the 
team to understand concepts and quick guides. When I joined the project 
we were completely out of time and this helping hand was key for finishing 
the project before expected and we could even make some extra polish.
- For Cyberpunk 2077 (20 environment artists) I had the chance of making 
some Maya tools for the team for speeding up the process of stacking UVs, 
worked on some environmental assets to know the content creation 
pipeline and integration with Red Engine and I had the chance of reading 
and learning from their content creation tools, specially texturing pipeline 
and materials creation.
- For Battlefield 2042 (45 environment artists) I worked during the whole 
production process (2 years), helping coding tools for easy texturing 
environmental assets in Maya and Painter, using a material layering system. 
I also debugged and helped DICE finding errors in Frostbite as they were 
updating the engine and validating the Frostbite versions, validated the 
correct setup of all the actors we sent to client in engine, even physics and 
destruction, created documentation about tools or undocumented new 
Frostbite updates for general use, taught the team about the new tools and 
warn about bugs and maintain a fluid communication with client 
stakeholders during all the production. I received a couple of good mentions 
from EA, and I also helped during some months in another EA project using 
the same engine at the same time I helped on Battlefield until 31st Union 
bought elite3d.
- Helped during 5 months in a non-released project as a Unreal Engine C++ 
game programmer.
- I did other tools during this period for other projects covered by NDA, like a 
python program using OpenCV for selecting too blurry images in a folder of 
photogrammetry pictures depending on the preferred range of blurriness 
for deleting them and helping to obtain better calculations of the points 
cloud or a complete 3d assets library software for storing, sharing and 
tagging 3d mehes including a 3d pbr viewer and an users-projects security 
system integrated with a jira plugin.

2K games in Valencia. As part of a big team of tech artists, I’m specialized in texturing 
tools, integration of them in engine and version control plugins and tools.
- Working closely to rendering engineering, materials, environment and 
characters teams to develop the tools for executing the pipeline desired by 
leads in each area.
- Developing tools environments for different softwares related to my area. 
Custom executables, manage of system path variables, tools folder 
structure, initial execution of scripts.

including version control managing and integration of different content 
creation softwares.
- Development of GLSL shaders for different softwares.
- Development of a multilayer material system for texturing integrated with 
engine.
- Manage my own task creation in agree with leads of different areas.
- Instructing teams on best practices and generating documentation and 
videos.

I'm working on my free time as advisor for advertisement and 3d animated films
companies helping to develop many kinds of projects for small and big companies as

parts and materials in as many possibilities in a level and take high quality 
renders after each iteration to obtain more than 3000 different variations 
for a NFT project.
- Created a multilayered material system for this NFT project for faster 
creation of the models materials variations and material iteration.
- Making Unreal Engine plugins for next release in Unreal Marketplace
